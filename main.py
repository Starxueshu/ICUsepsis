Current prevention strategies for trauma-related infection/sepsis include infection prevention through surgical management, prophylactic antibiotics, tetanus vaccination, and immunomodulatory interventions, as well as organ dysfunction prevention through pharmaceuticals, temporary intravascular shunts, lung-protective strategies, enteral immunonutrition, and acupuncture. In addition, timely administration of antibiotics, fluid resuscitation, and source control can improve outcomes and prevent the development of septic shock.")
st.subheader('Model information')
st.markdown('The predictive model was constructed utilizing the advanced XGBoosting machine algorithm, yielding an impressive area under the curve (AUC) value of 0.912 (95%CI: 0.880-0.935). To further validate its robustness, the model underwent rigorous external validation, resulting in an AUC of 0.817 (95%CI: 0.783-0.861). This innovative online calculator, freely accessible and exclusively intended for research purposes, has been specifically designed to comprehensively assess the risk of sepsis in critically injured patients within intensive care units (ICUs). By leveraging cutting-edge machine learning techniques and the most up-to-date scientific literature, this tool empowers healthcare professionals to make more accurate and timely decisions, ultimately improving patient outcomes and reducing mortality rates.')
